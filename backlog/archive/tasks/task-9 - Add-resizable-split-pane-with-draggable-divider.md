## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Add a draggable divider line between the side list and content area that allows users to resize the panel widths. The divider should be a visible line that can be grabbed and dragged horizontally to adjust the split ratio between the two panes.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] #3 Dragging adjusts width of both panels in real-time

<!-- AC:END -->
